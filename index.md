## CLIForms
> Event-driven console UI made simple

CLIForms is a set of C#/.Net components and engine allowing to create a text-based UI for your Powershell scripts or C#/.Net console apps in minutes.

This project is based on the [CLRCLI](https://github.com/PhonicUK/CLRCLI) of PhonicUK. Most of the engine has been rewriten and there is no compatibility between the 2 but a big thanks to him to have started this great project.
